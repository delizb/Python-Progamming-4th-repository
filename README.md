project #1
https://github.com/delizb/Project-1-Oranges-vs-Grapefruit-pt-1
Description: This project was focused on Data analytics and is part 1 of a two parter project. The first part is focused on aspects such as KNN algorithms, Confusion Matrix, etc. The project is focused on the start to a data analytics presentation related project and is meant to showcase data analyzation as a whole.

Project #2
https://github.com/delizb/Project-2-Oranges-vs-Grapefruit-pt2-
Description: A continuation of the first project done in my python programming class. This part focuses on data visualization that is combined with the previous part involving data analyzation. Seaborn and MATPLOTLIB are used to present the visual depictions and it's purpose of showing visible data to a audience.

Project #3
https://github.com/delizb/Project-3-Final-Project
Description: A english to spanish translation code created by me. It was meant to translate english statements into spanish statements as my original vision for this final project was to make communication between spanish and non-speakers much more easier in the state of new jersey. On top of that, I plant to hopefully improve the code to add more language translation aspects in this code in the future as well.
